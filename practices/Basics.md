# Understand Basic types in TS

1. Plain Definition + Overview
2. Why do we care?
3. Examples
4. When to use this?

`Type`

Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

`‘red’`

1. it’s a string
2. It is a value that has all the properties and methods that we assume that a string has.
